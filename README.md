# mern-stack-expense-tracker-app
This is an expense tracker app based on MERN ( MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS ) stack. Its client side is made in React using React hooks and context API + useReducer() hook for the state management. I haven't used redux coz I felt context API + useReducer() hook is better and is the new way of handling the state management. And in the backend, I have used Express.js for the server side handling and MongoDB for storing the transactions in the database.<br/>
